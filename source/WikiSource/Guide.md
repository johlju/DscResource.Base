To create a PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) class-based resource called `MyDscResource`, we'll follow the structure and comments outlined in the `ResourceBase` and `SqlAudit` classes. This guide will provide a step-by-step approach to creating a basic template for your DSC resource, which you can then extend based on your specific requirements.

### Step 1: Define the Class and Inheritance

Start by defining your class and ensure it inherits from `ResourceBase` to leverage common functionality.

```powershell
class MyDscResource : ResourceBase
{
}
```

### Step 2: Define Properties

Define the properties your resource requires. Use `[DscProperty()]` to mark properties that DSC will manage. You can specify if a property is a key, required, or read-only by adding appropriate attributes.

```powershell
class MyDscResource : ResourceBase
{
    [DscProperty(Key)]
    [string] $Name

    [DscProperty()]
    [string] $Description

    [DscProperty()]
    [ValidateSet('Present', 'Absent')]
    [string] $Ensure = 'Present'
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Get Method

The `Get()` method should return the current state of the resource. This involves initializing a hashtable and populating it with the current state of each property.

```powershell
[MyDscResource] Get()
{
    $currentState = @{
        Name        = $this.Name
        Description = $this.Description
        Ensure      = $this.Ensure
    }

    return $currentState
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the Test Method

The `Test()` method checks if the system is in the desired state. It returns `$true` if no changes are needed or `$false` if the system needs to be corrected.

```powershell
[System.Boolean] Test()
{
    # Logic to determine if the system is in the desired state
    # Return $true if no changes are needed, otherwise $false
}
```

### Step 5: Implement the Set Method

The [`Set()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjohlju%2Fsource%2FSqlServerDsc%2Fsource%2FClasses%2F020.SqlAudit.ps1%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A215%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%5D "source/Classes/020.SqlAudit.ps1") method enforces the desired state. This is where you put the logic to create, modify, or remove the configuration based on the `Ensure` property.

```powershell
[void] Set()
{
    if ($this.Ensure -eq 'Present')
    {
        # Logic to ensure the resource is present
    }
    elseif ($this.Ensure -eq 'Absent')
    {
        # Logic to ensure the resource is removed
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Implement Helper Methods (Optional)

Depending on your resource's complexity, you might need helper methods. For example, methods to validate input or to encapsulate repetitive tasks.

```powershell
hidden [void] MyHelperMethod()
{
    # Helper method logic
}
```

### Step 7: Compile and Test Your Resource

After implementing your DSC resource, compile it into a MOF file using the `mof` compiler and test it in your DSC configurations to ensure it behaves as expected.

This guide provides a basic template for creating a DSC class-based resource. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to add more properties, validation, or logic to your resource.
